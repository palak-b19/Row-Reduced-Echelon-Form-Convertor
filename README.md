# RREF Matrix and System Solver

This repository contains Python code for performing `Row Reduction to Echelon Form (RREF)` on a given matrix and solving the associated system of linear equations. The code uses the Gaussian elimination method to convert the input matrix to its reduced row-echelon form and then extracts information about the variables and constants to represent the system of linear equations. This project involves understanding of `Linear Algebra` and `Python implementation`

## Introduction

The provided Python code consists of three main functions:

1. `rref`: Converts a given matrix to its Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF).
2. `dict_val`: Extracts information about variables and constants from the RREF matrix.
3. `para_eq`: Represents the system of linear equations based on the RREF matrix and variable information.

The code is designed to handle square and rectangular matrices.

## Usage

To use the code, you can call the `rref` function with a matrix as an argument. The resulting RREF matrix can be used with the `dict_val` and `para_eq` functions to obtain information about the system of linear equations.

```python
# Example Usage
matrix_input =  [[4,4,4],[2,2,2],[1,1,1]]
rref_matrix = rref(matrix_input)
variable_info = dict_val(rref_matrix)
modified_dict = simp_dic(variable_info)
para_eq(modified_dict, rref_matrix)
```

## Functions

### `rref(A)`

Converts the input matrix `A` to its Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF).

- Input:
  - `A`: The input matrix as a list of lists.

- Output:
  - Returns the RREF matrix.

### `dict_val(rref_mt)`

Extracts information about variables and constants from the RREF matrix.

- Input:
  - `rref_mt`: The RREF matrix.

- Output:
  - Returns a dictionary containing information about variables and constants.

### `simp_dic(dict_main)`

Simplifies the variable information dictionary by setting coefficients to zero for variables corresponding to free columns.

- Input:
  - `dict_main`: The variable information dictionary.

- Output:
  - Returns the simplified variable information dictionary.

### `para_eq(modify_dict, rref)`

Represents the system of linear equations based on the RREF matrix and variable information.

- Input:
  - `modify_dict`: The simplified variable information dictionary.
  - `rref`: The RREF matrix.

- Output:
  - Prints the system of linear equations.

## Example

```python
# Example Usage
matrix_input =  [[4,4,4],[2,2,2],[1,1,1]]
rref_matrix = rref(matrix_input)
variable_info = dict_val(rref_matrix)
modified_dict = simp_dic(variable_info)
para_eq(modified_dict, rref_matrix)
```

Output:

```
['X0', 'X1', 'X2']=[[-0.0, 1.0, -2.0]X2 + 0.0X0 + 0.0X1, 1.0X0 + 1.0X1 + 1.0X2, 0.0X0 + 0.0X1 + 0.0X2]
```

## File Input

You can also provide the input matrix via a text file. The file should have the following format:

```
Rows: <number_of_rows>
Cols: <number_of_columns>
<element_11> <element_12> ... <element_1n>
<element_21> <element_22> ... <element_2n>
...
<element_m1> <element_m2> ... <element_mn>
```

You can use the provided `matrix_input.txt` file as an example.
